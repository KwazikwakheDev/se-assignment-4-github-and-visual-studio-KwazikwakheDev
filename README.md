**Primary functions and features**
- Version control is used to track changes to code and allow developers to revert previous states.
- Repositories is where the code is stored and each is project is organized in it repository.
- Collaboration supports teamwork by allowing developers to work on the same project, share code and merge changes.
- Pull requests which allows or enables developers to propose changes to a codebase which can be reviewed and merged with.

2. Repositories on GitHub:
 What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
